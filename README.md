## Create a demo calendar application

The aim of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React & Redux. You can use 'npm mock-json-server' to mock the server data and do the proper API calles. You need to use *REST API* to get the data.

You should take no more than 4h to complete this task.

You should start by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month – along the lines of the below illustration:
